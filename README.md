## Project Description
ChaosPad is a deceptively professional-looking text editor that secretly sabotages your writing with delightfully chaotic features. It looks like a normal notepad but replaces your words, scrambles your scrolling, and types gibberish when you're not looking!

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Regular text editors are *too* reliable and predictable. Writers have become complacent, expecting their words to stay exactly as they type them. Where's the adventure? Where's the surprise? Life is chaos, so why shouldn't our text editors be chaotic too?

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)
ChaosPad introduces controlled chaos into your writing experience! It features word replacement on space/enter, chaotic undo that removes random text, auto-typing gibberish after inactivity, random text zooming, inverted scroll directions, and animated bubble feedback - all disguised as a sleek, professional text editor.

## Technical Details

### Technologies/Components Used

**For Software:**
- **Languages:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Frameworks:** Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks - pure chaos!)
- **Libraries:** Font Awesome (for icons)
- **Tools:** VS Code, Browser Developer Tools
- **CSS Features:** Glassmorphism, CSS Grid/Flexbox, Keyframe Animations, CSS Variables
- **JavaScript Features:** DOM Manipulation, Event Handling, ContentEditable API, Selection API

## Implementation

### For Software:

#### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd NotePad

# No installation required - it's pure HTML/CSS/JS!
# Just open in any modern web browser
```

#### Run
```bash
# Option 1: Direct file access
# Simply open index.html in your browser

# Option 2: Local server (recommended)
# Using Python
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js
npx http-server

# Using VS Code Live Server extension
# Right-click on index.html -> "Open with Live Server"
```

## Project Demo

### Video
[Add your demo video link here]
*Video demonstrates all chaos features: typing words that get replaced, chaotic undo creating floating bubbles, auto-typing gibberish after inactivity, random zoom changes, and inverted scrolling*

### Additional Demos
- **Live Demo:** [Add GitHub Pages or deployment link]
- **Interactive Features Demo:** Try typing "hello world" and pressing space - watch the chaos unfold!
- **Chaos Level Testing:** Leave the editor idle for 5 seconds after typing to see auto-gibberish in action

## Chaos Features Breakdown

### üîÑ Word Replacement System
- Replaces typed words with random words from a curated list on space/enter
- Animated bubbles show original‚Üínew transformations
- Color-coded bubbles for different triggers (space vs enter)

### üéØ Chaotic Undo
- Removes 1-20% of text randomly instead of normal undo
- Creates floating letter bubbles that can be clicked to restore
- Bubbles appear at approximate original text positions

### ‚å®Ô∏è Auto-Typing Gibberish
- Activates after 5 seconds of user inactivity (only after user starts typing)
- Types 5 randomly generated gibberish words
- Visual feedback with purple borders and background

### üîç Dynamic Zoom Chaos
- Randomly zooms text between 85%-115% after typing stops
- Smooth 2-second transitions with blue notification bubbles
- Only triggers after user interaction

### üìú Scroll Direction Chaos
- 15% chance to invert scroll direction for one scroll action
- Subtle red flash indicates when scroll chaos occurs
- Maintains normal scrolling most of the time

### üé® Bubble Feedback System
- Animated bubbles for all chaos events
- Click interactions for undo bubbles
- Staggered animations and auto-cleanup
